The source is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set".

##Feature Selection

The set of variables that were estimated from the input data are: 
• mean(): Mean value
• std(): Standard deviation

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:
• gravityMean
• tBodyAccMean
• tBodyAccJerkMean
• tBodyGyroMean
• tBodyGyroJerkMean

Other estimates have been removed for the purpose of this excercise.
